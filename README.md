This project will demonstrate how to use kivy to develop a cross platform mobile app written in Python.

# Motivation

It's something to do I guess.

# Pre-requisites

This project uses **Pipenv** for the sandboxed virtual environment, so you will need to install this prior to modifying this project. See the installation steps here:

```http
https://pipenv-fork.readthedocs.io/en/latest/install.html#installing-pipenv
```

# Python Installation

A note on the Python version. For the purposes of this project I have used Kivy. Kivy currently *does not* support Python version 3.8. For that reason please do not attempt to modofy this project with **Python version 3.8.x** as it won't work. If you already have python 3.8.x installed, don't fret. You can install **Pyenv** and use multiple versions of Python on your machine. See how to install and use Pyenv here:

```http
https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv
```
